**IceNomCl - Icelandic Nominalized Clauses**

The data presented in the folders _corpora_ and _questionnaires_ of this repository are related to the following doctoral dissertation:

Garofalo, Mirko. (2025). _Clausal Nominalization in Icelandic_. Ph.D. thesis in Icelandic linguistics. University of Iceland. https://opinvisindi.is/handle/20.500.11815/5552

The data from corpora have been gathered from the Icelandic Gigaword Corpus (Risamálheild). The data from questionnaires have been obtained through online forms, while the ones from oral interviews (on clausal indirect objects) have been obtained orally.

The folder _IcePaHC_ contains diachronic data on Icelandic nominalized clauses obtained from the Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (project in progress).
